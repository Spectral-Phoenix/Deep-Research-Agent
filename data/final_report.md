## OpenAI Sora: Purpose and Core Functionality

**OpenAI Sora is a text-to-video AI model designed to generate realistic and imaginative videos from text prompts, images, and existing video.** It leverages diffusion model techniques, starting with static noise and refining it over time to create coherent video content. Sora can generate entirely new videos or extend existing ones, handling diverse durations, resolutions, and aspect ratios.

Sora's architecture involves compressing videos into a latent space, breaking down frames into patches, and using transformer models to process these patches. This allows the model to understand and generate content across space and time, maintaining consistency in lighting, texture, and object persistence. A key component is the spatiotemporal transformer, which operates in four dimensions (height, width, time, features) to ensure coherent motion.

For example, a user can input the prompt "Two people walking through Tokyo in the snow" and Sora will generate a video depicting this scene.

## Sora's Main Features

**Sora offers several key features centered around AI-driven video creation, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video conversion, and video remixing.** The text-to-video functionality allows users to create videos up to one minute long from text prompts. Sora can generate complex scenes featuring multiple characters, specific motions, and detailed backgrounds.

The image-to-video conversion animates still images, while video remixing allows users to blend existing footage with new styles. These features democratize video production, making it accessible to users with minimal technical expertise. For example, filmmakers can prototype scenes or create animations without expensive sets or CGI.

Sora's capabilities are underpinned by advanced AI technologies, including GPT-4 and image recognition algorithms. These technologies enable accurate interpretation of text input and the creation of detailed videos. The model also understands how objects exist in the physical world, accurately interpreting props and generating compelling characters.

## Sora's Technical Architecture

**Sora employs a diffusion transformer architecture to convert text prompts into high-quality videos.** This process involves several key steps. First, the input text is analyzed using NLP techniques to extract meaning and intent. This information guides the video generation process. Raw video data is compressed into a latent representation, capturing both spatial and temporal information.

The compressed video is then broken down into spacetime patches, similar to tokens in large language models. These patches are processed by a scaling transformer, which organizes them to create the overall video structure. Diffusion models then add detail to each patch, refining the video from random noise to a coherent visual scene.

For example, if a user enters the prompt "A dog running in a park," Sora's NLP component identifies the key elements (dog, running, park). The system then generates a video by iteratively refining spacetime patches until they accurately represent the described scene.

## Limitations and Challenges of Sora

**Sora, while impressive, faces limitations in accurately simulating the physical world and maintaining consistency in long videos.** Glitches arise from the model's flawed reconstruction of reality, akin to "hallucinations" in LLMs, rather than stemming directly from training data. This leads to inconsistencies in object permanence, motion, and physics, particularly in complex scenarios like gymnastics, where precise motion and physics are crucial.

One key challenge is Sora's struggle with understanding and predicting dynamic object state changes. In long-duration videos, Sora may produce inconsistent plots or details due to difficulties maintaining contextual consistency. A Bytedance Research study showed AI video models rely on surface-level features from training data instead of learning universal rules.

Compared to Google's Veo 2, Sora is limited to 1080p resolution and shorter video clips. Veo 2 prioritizes realism and adherence to real-world physics, potentially offering a superior visual experience for professional content creation.
